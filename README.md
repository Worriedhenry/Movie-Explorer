## Movie explorer 

**Movie Explorer** Lets you get information about 1000's of different movies/series/episodes with just few click . The site is server less means it does not have backend server .The reason for this is that we are using external api's to fetch details and there is no authentication functions. This eliminates need of a backend server.

- **Responsive and Accessible**: The platform is fully responsive, ensuring optimal performance across all devices. Whether you’re on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

1. **Search the show**: Search your favourite shows using search bar on home page.
2. **Apply filters**: Apply filters is result are large.
3. **Click for details **: Click on the show for details of the show.
